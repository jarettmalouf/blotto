               32:00 TOTAL time spent

I discussed my solution with Kevin Rono, Daly Joseph, Jonathan Jalbert, Alina Kramp, Leslie Espinoza, and Pablo Garza.

For me, the problems with this pset came with the planning. Blotto is basically one big arithmetic problem where your data is scattered throughout a bunch of different arrays and hashmaps. Wrapping my head around accessing elements in a hashmap was a battle in and of itself, but once I understood that, Blotto became a traditional, fun coding problem. As for ADT, freeing the right elements at the right times also presented a problem, as that whole concept (malloc'ing and freeing) is novel and unintuitive to me. A final problem I ran into was when I was submitting Blotto –– while it would make normally in my terminal –– none of the test cases would run because they were immediately killed. Once I got Blotto up and running, I ran into more trouble with the invalid input cases, and I had to first familiarize myself with the switch structure of entry.c. I ended up, however, solving most of those problems not in entry.c itself but in error-targeted conditionals in blotto.c. My last couple errors were with an error I could not pinpoint within qsort, and it ended up being because I was typecasting doubles as ints and thus losing precision. Finally, a few valgrind errors later (all having to do with freeing at the right times), I was passing the 36 test cases.
